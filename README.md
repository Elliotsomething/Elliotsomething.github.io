### Features of this template:

- base on bootstrap v3
- post tags will be listed in the meta `keywords` of the html head
- use google-code-prettify to highlight code
- have a 'go to top' flow button
- integrate many services, such as, disqus or duoshuo for comments, google analytics or cnzz for website statics. If you don't want one of them, just comment of delete it in `_config.yml`



### If you want to use this template, please do following setups:

- delete all posts under `_posts`
- modify somethings in `_config.yml`, I believe you can understand how to modify by those comments
- there are some google adsense, if you want to delete them, you can modify `_layouts/page.html` and `_includes/side.html` by those comments in the html files.
